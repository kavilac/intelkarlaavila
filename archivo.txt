Doctree elements: table, tgroup, colspec, thead, tbody, row, entry.

ReStructuredText provides two syntax variants for delineating table cells: Grid Tables and Simple Tables. Tables are also generated by the CSV Table and List Table directives. The table directive is used to add a table title or specify options.

As with other body elements, blank lines are required before and after tables. Tables' left edges should align with the left edge of preceding text blocks; if indented, the table is considered to be part of a block quote.
